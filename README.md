This project attempts to predict NBA game winners against the bookmakers using stats from [NBA stats website](https:/basketball-reference.com) using my own [parser](https://github.com/martosinc/nba-parser). All code is written in Python with the help of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org).
